## Prerequisites

Before running the app, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

1. **Flutter and Dart**  
   Make sure Flutter and Dart are installed and set up on your machine. You can check this by running the command `flutter --version` in your terminal/command prompt. If Flutter is not installed, follow the instructions [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

2. **Suitable IDE**  
   Use an IDE that supports Flutter. Popular options include [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) and the recommended [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).

3. **Flutter and Dart Plugins (Android Studio)**  
   If using Android Studio, ensure the Flutter and Dart plugins are installed. Go to `File -> Settings -> Plugins`, search for Flutter and Dart, and install them.

4. **Flutter Extension (VS Code)**  
   If using VS Code, install the Flutter extension by going to the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`), searching for the Flutter extension, and installing it.

5. **Device/Emulator**  
   Ensure you have a device to run the app on, either a physical Android/iOS device or an emulator/simulator. If using an emulator/simulator, ensure it is properly set up.

6. **Run Flutter Doctor**  
   Before starting, run the `flutter doctor` command to check for any missing dependencies and complete your setup.

   ```bash
   flutter doctor
